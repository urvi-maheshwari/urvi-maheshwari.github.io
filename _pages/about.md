## About Me 

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Experimental Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. Before this, I completed a B.A. (Hons). in Psychology, History, and the Scholar's Electives Program at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. I've been told I should have a website, so this is my attempt at making one.

## My Research 

All animals experience physical reality: we represent space, estimate quantities, and discriminate durations. Unlike other animals, however, humans rely on abstract symbols to organize our experience – we create maps and models to navigate space, design clocks and calendars to keep time, and construct counting systems to reason about numbers. In fact, we reason about entities, places, and times that we never directly experience – we imagine places we’ve never been, budget and trade amounts we’ve never seen, ruminate over counterfactual pasts, and make plans for multiple possible futures. Motivated to build explanations of our experience, we construct scientific theories, build complex technologies, create art, and write fiction not just to describe how the world is, but imagine how it could be. I study the foundations of such abstract thought.

My research program is centered around three broad questions: 

  (1) what role does our sensory-perceptual experience play in the construction of more abstract concepts? 
  
  (2) how does language facilitate abstract thought? 
  
  (3) what logical processes and sensorimotor procedures are involved in learning? 

I answer these questions via empirical, in-lab and field studies exploring the development of numerical cognition, spatial concepts, temporal reasoning, modal representations, and counterfactual thought among children and adults across various linguistic, developmental, and cultural contexts.
